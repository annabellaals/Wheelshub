# Testing Guide for WheelsHub

This document provides instructions for running test cases for the WheelsHub Django project. Testing ensures that the application functions as expected and helps identify any issues.

## Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Version 3.x
- **Django**: Version x.x (or the version specified in your `requirements.txt`)
- **Test dependencies**: Make sure you have installed all required packages.

To install dependencies, run:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests
### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory

Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where your manage.py file is located:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

### 2. Run the Test Suite

Use Django's built-in test runner to execute the test cases:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

This command will automatically discover and run all the test cases defined in your project.

### 3. Running Specific Tests

If you want to run tests for a specific app or test case, use the following syntax:

```bash
python manage.py test app_name
```
Or to run a specific test case:

```bash
python manage.py test app_name.tests.TestClass.test_method
```
### 4. View Test Results

After running the tests, you will see a summary of the test results in your terminal. The results will indicate which tests passed, failed, or were skipped.

## Writing Tests
For more information on writing tests, refer to the [Django Testing Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/testing/).

### Example Test
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a Django test case:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse

class WheelsHubViewTests(TestCase):
    def test_home_page_status_code(self):
        response = self.client.get(reverse('home'))
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```

In this example, a test case checks if the home page returns a status code of 200 (OK).

## Continuous Integration
If you use a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI, Jenkins), ensure your test suite runs automatically on code changes. Configure your CI/CD pipeline to include the test commands specified above.

## Troubleshooting
- Database Issues: Make sure your test database is properly set up. Django creates a test database automatically, but issues might arise if your database settings are incorrect.
- Dependency Errors: Verify that all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Django version.
- Test Failures: Review test output for details on failures and correct any issues in your code.

## Conclusion
Running tests is crucial for maintaining the quality and reliability of the WheelsHub project. Regular testing helps catch bugs early and ensures that changes do not introduce new issues.
